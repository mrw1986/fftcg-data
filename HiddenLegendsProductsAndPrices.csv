<br><br><strong> Following “Hidden Hope” and “Hidden Trials,” this third installment in the “Hidden” series – “Hidden Legends” – continues to feature the new Limit Break ability. Providing a new strategy to FFTCG and dynamically changing the way matches are played, the Limit Break ability grows even more in the Hidden Legends set. In this set, we will be introducing multi-element Limit Break cards. This will further expand the range of deck construction, allowing players to find infinite ways to enjoy not just matches, but also deck building.
<br><br>For the collectors, we are once again including a very rare, special version full art card (Special Card). From the latest mainline title – FINAL FANTASY XVI – comes protagonist Clive [24-005L] appearing as our Special Card. This card is foil-stamped with the signature of Kazuya Takahashi, who created the FINAL FANTASY XVI package art used on this card.
<br><br>On top of the we’ve included an Ifrit (XVI) [24-001L] card as the Buy-a-Box Promo.
<br><br>Furthermore, we have brought back the ever-popular Legacy Cards, which are full-art versions of previous Legend cards. In this set, we will be including Minfilia [6-079L], Akstar [18-107L], and Unei [19-119L].
